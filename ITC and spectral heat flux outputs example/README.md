## to obtain ITC and spectral heat flux figure, follow the following steps:
1. run `python main_ITC.py` to obtain the following information:
* layer 1 thickness
* layer 2 thickness
* heat flux
* temperature difference
* effective conductance
* interfacial thermal conductance (ITC)
2. run `python main_spectral.py` to get the figure named **almaBTE_spectral_heat_flux.jpeg**
